In order to create an executable, place the file setup.py into the repository "Projet3"

Open prompt and go to the projet3 repository,

Use the command line: " python setup.py build"

A repo "build" is create into the "projet3"

You need to add the "ressources" repo into the repo containing the main.exe.

And it's done ! :)
